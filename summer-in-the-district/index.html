<h2>Day 1: Homebody</h2><p>The doors stayed locked. I worked all day in bed. I drank several cups of coffee. This is a scary place, but, hell, this basement apartment is cozy. Thanks Brian!</p><h2>Day 2: Cortado and a Haircut</h2><p>The Flying Fish Cafe is a lovely third wave place near Mount Pleasant and 16th NW. It&rsquo;s molded ceilings and vast art collection add a nice touch to the otherwise clean and plain interior. They offer a widespread range of drinks: cortados, pourovers, iced coffee growlers, and twenty different types of tea. It&rsquo;s affordably priced; even the sandwiches seem like a value.</p><div class="clearfix"><figure class="grid-full"><a data-event="Clicked fluidbox on Summer In The District" role="fluidbox" class="" href="http://coletownsend.com/assets/images/inline/ff-cortado.jpg" title="the Flying Fish Cortado"><img src="http://coletownsend.com/assets/images/inline/ff-cortado.jpg" alt="the Flying Fish Cortado" title="the Flying Fish Cortado"></a></figure></div>
