At Williams College, there are <u>three</u> listing services one must be sure to notify in order to reach the majority of students.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>The goal of this project was to create an app which is intuitive for schedule organization, while allowing students to curate what types of events appear in various feeds that ultimately filter into one macro-feed for each day. Students would also be able create events, and then choose whom to invite. Ideally, it would also help relieve the often crazed and spontaneous decision to attend an event.</p><h3>Multiple Feeds</h3><p>Students can swipe through several different feeds. The feeds are: <strong>My Horizon</strong>, the macro-feed of events applying directly to the student on the given day, <strong>Campus Events</strong>, which lists college organized events, <strong>Athletics</strong>, which lists sporting events, and <strong>After Hours</strong>, which lists campus events after dinner (parties and such). There is also an <strong>Activity</strong> feed, which lists notifications and event alterations, <strong>Dining</strong>, which lists meal options based on the time, and <strong>Circles</strong>, which is very similar to Twitter&rsquo;s lists; it lets users organize and manage lists of people for invites. There is also <strong>Settings</strong> page where users can control what types of events appear in their respective feeds, as well as a help page which will include a copy of the initial swipe-through demo.</p><h2>Context</h2><p>I was asked to design the interface and user experience for the app. While doing so, it&rsquo;s morphed from something larger into what I have described above. Originally it was 6 lists, including what I had above, as well as a page for invites, a page for each sport, a menu page for each dining hall, a help page which listed emergency numbers on campus, and a settings page. T_hat is a whole lot of screens to swipe through_. I discussed with the project managers the importance of minimizing how much the user has to do. <em>The goal isn&rsquo;t to overwhelm the user, it is to disguise the complexity of the schedule and the app, by creating a simple and organized interface</em>. Since then we have paired it down to the four list pages, Activity, Circles, Dining, Settings, and Help. It&rsquo;s still a lot, and we&rsquo;re working on pairing it down more as we comb through the app. I&rsquo;m working with them to help define the most important and common tasks, so that I can simplify and streamline those functions.</p><h2>Menu Choices</h2><p>To keep each of the different pages from overwhelming the user, I needed to come up with a menu that was easy to access, not too cluttered, and created some sort of page hierarchy.</p><p>Initially I considered a footer menu with icons for each list. As there were more than 4 pages, it wasn&rsquo;t ideal. I also sketched up a header drop down. By clicking the header, one could choose between lists. The bottom would contain less important pages such as Dining, Circles, Help, and Setting.</p><h2>Why Offscreen?</h2><p>I first came upon the offscreen menu on CSS Tricks. Chris Coyier made <a href="http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/umEgv" target="_blank">a demo</a> that used sibling selectors and a radio button to open and close a hidden menu. Since then, many apps have used side menus and is an accepted practice. It was ultimately easier to use with an omniscient and dedicated menu page. I know many people really enjoy the novelty of an offscreen menu, but it makes sense from a usability standpoint as well. It creates more space for the app as a whole and the menu doesn&rsquo;t feel cramped. By removing the menu features, I was able to simplify what was otherwise a bit overwhelming. I could also eliminate the tab navigation and get a better environment for listings.</p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co2014/03/peck-menu.png"></p></article></section><footer data-no-instant><script src="assets/javascript/all.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function() {
