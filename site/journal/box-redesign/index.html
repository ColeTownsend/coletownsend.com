I didn&rsquo;t want to radically change the site; it&rsquo;s relatively intuitive to use as I am familiar with CloudApp, Dropbox, and numerous other cloud based services. One thing I noticed was that there were many different functions on the viewing page. When I was revising the viewing page, I wanted to clean it up. My goal was to make the primary function of each page very clear.</p><h2>Viewer</h2><p>I started with the viewer itself. There was too much going on, as you can see in the crowded image above. I stripped it down to just navigation arrows and a full screen mode. As a user of many cloud apps, I know that I&rsquo;ve never used many features from the viewer itself. The navbar provided me with what I needed in an unobtrusive way.</p><h3>Document Viewer</h3><p>I wanted to mimic the functions of Google Doc Viewer and Preview. The current functionality is fine, but it is not accessible. It requires flash and is a bit slow to respond. I found myself frustrated as I scrolled through a longer pdf. The scrolling isn&rsquo;t smooth — it catches frequently. Additionally, the cursor hand moves at a slower speed in the doc viewer than it does out of it. This isn&rsquo;t intuitive and can confuse users. Although I can&rsquo;t reflect these changes in my visual representation, it is something I would address with the dev team.</p><p>Specifically for the visuals, I aimed to minimize what was going on in the document viewer. I feel that it&rsquo;s better to directly be able to influence specifically which page is viewed, rather than clicking through each one individually.</p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-box-doc.png"></p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-my-doc.png"></p><h3>Video Viewer</h3><p>I wish I could show an example of the video viewer. Unfortunately it was not included in the free version, a download was necessary for free users. Paid users were allowed a previewer. With the video player, I aimed to keep it consistent with other video players common to cloud viewers. Users are familiar with the layout.</p><p><img stye="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-video.png"></p><h2>Nav</h2><p>The nav I found to be a bit inconsistent and congested. I had a hard time discerning which icon did what, and was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of icons. I shifted the upgrade feature farthest right, so it remains unobtrusive to the user. I also separated the tasks and messages drop down into two separate features. They aren&rsquo;t peas and carrots or PB&amp;J. Tasks and messages should be separated. Instead of wondering whether it is a message form a coworker or a task from the project manager, the user will know immediately. Simplification is sometimes confused with subtracting. In this case it means simplification meant adding an extra icon to eliminate a step for the user.</p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-box-nav.png"></p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-my-nav.png"></p><h3>Sub Nav</h3><p>I cleared the sub nav up by using a bit more padding and dropping the font- size. There is already a contrasting color for the sub nav and the visual hierarchy is established without using that big of a font. Slightly smaller font will work just as well and will create a bit more breathing room for the title of the document. I also eliminated the text next to the icons. I feel that icons should already communicate the function of the button. Granted this is highly dependent on the users, and some sort of A/B testing would be helpful to make the decision.</p><h2>Comments</h2><p>The comment area was cluttered with links for various types of comments. The comment area shouldn&rsquo;t be intimidating or hard to read! It should be helpful and fun. At Box, the commenting area is also used to assign tasks, perhaps on a document or a TPS report.</p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-box-comment.png"></p><p><img src="http://v3.twnsnd.co/images/inline/box-my-comment.png"></p></article></section><footer data-no-instant><script src="/assets/javascript/all.min.01a33bd4.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function() {
