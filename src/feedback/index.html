<p class="form-text">It's important for me to get feedback from my clients and friends. Not just because it helps me work better, but because I care about your experience. The next time we work together, I'd love for you to find that I addressed one of the less-than-awesome aspects of our last project. Also, I would love to be able to tell future clients about how great your experience was.</p>
