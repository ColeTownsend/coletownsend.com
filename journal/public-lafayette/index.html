But seriously watch that ^^</p><p>You don&rsquo;t need to be a local tastemaker, hipster, or coffee snob to realize that Public is the best coffee in Buffalo, New York. All it takes is a single cup. They won&rsquo;t chastise you for adding milk, sugar, or honey though they may ask you to try your drink black. They&rsquo;re a small, friendly business. Chances are that you know someone that knows them from before their days in the coffee business. They&rsquo;re big on building relationships with customers and local restaurants.</p><p>Offering weekly fresh roasted coffee, they deliver the brightest, freshest cup of coffee you could ever hope to have. Their staples are a blend from South America, sourced from farmers with which they have close relationships. I&rsquo;ve had their Bali and Yirgacheffe coffees. The Yirgacheffe is bright, acidic, and a bit lemony. It&rsquo;s a great pick me up early in the morning. The Bali is new as of March 2015 to the Public bullpen. It&rsquo;s claimed to have flavors of strawberry, dark chocolate, and earth(?). The espresso shot was crystal bright and a bit fruity with no noticeable bitterness. The pour over was delightful &mdash; very much in tune with the strawberry and definitely a hint of that dark cocoa bitter taste. Once it cooled, it was downright silky.</p><p>Their baked goods are from Elm Street Bakery and Butter Block. While I haven&rsquo;t tried either of these, I know their ingredients and products are top notch, and reasonably priced as far as high end baked goods go.</p><h2>Location, Location, Location</h2><p>Public is located at the renovated and restored bar in the Lafayette Hotel lobby. It&rsquo;s straight out of the 20s with highly geometric and subtly ornate decorations and details. The ovular room is made up of warm, light colored wood, marble, accented with metal. Filling the center of the room, there are couches, comfy metal and leather motorcycle sidecar like chairs, as well as tall brushed metal chairs surrounding metal clawfooted tables closer to the bar. . Embracing the interior seating space is Public, Bourbon and Sugar, a flower shop, and two restaurants. Public extends into the interior space with a curved marble and wood bar, fitted with a gorgeous 1920s antique display case for their baked goods. Across the room stand two tall marble and wood islands, tall walls of marble cut out to serve as fireplaces to warm and brighten the seating area.</p><div class="clearfix"><figure class="grid-full"><a data-event="Clicked fluidbox on Public at Hotel Lafayette" role="fluidbox" class="" href="http://coletownsend.com/assets/images/inline/lafayette-wall-art.jpg" title="Pan Am Fever"><img src="http://coletownsend.com/assets/images/inline/lafayette-wall-art.jpg" alt="Pan Am Fever" title="Pan Am Fever"></a></figure></div><h3>The Bar</h3><p>The coffee bar is clean, lacking the normal metal behemoth that is the espresso machine. Public is outfitted with a ModBar, which elegantly stows much of the internals under the bar, exposing only the beautiful chromed espresso taps, milk frother, and hot water tap. Behind it is a old hotel mailbox shelf, now filed with red letters spelling out &ldquo;public.&rdquo; Soon they&rsquo;re planning on adding a coldbrew addition to the right half of the bar, which is currently unused.</p><div class="post-width clearfix"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/PublicEspresso">@PublicEspresso</a> at the Lafayette is absolutely beautiful.
